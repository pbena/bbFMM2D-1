%% Get Input Data From Files

% Read data from input file

charges    = Data(:,3:end);         % Sets of Charges

%% Fast Matrix Vector Product

% 1 Building FMM Tree
tic;
ATree = H2_2D_Tree(nChebNodes, location, N, m); % FMM Tree
fprintf('\n Total time taken for FMM(build tree) is: %f  seconds\n', toc);


% 2 Calculating Potential 
tic;

potential_kex1 = calculate_Potential(kex1, ATree, charges);
fprintf('\n Total time taken for FMM(calculations) is: %f seconds\n', toc);


%% Exact Matrix Vector Product

% Calculate potential Exact
tic

potential_exact = Q * charges;
fprintf('\n Total time taken for Exact(calculations) is: %f seconds\n', toc);
% Error Calculation
fprintf('\n Maximum Error is: %0.3e \n', norm(potential_exact-potential_kex1)/norm(potential_exact));
